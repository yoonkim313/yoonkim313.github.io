# Jeoni's Blog
Hi! This blog is for my personal record on paper reviews published in recent three years. My scope of interest encompasses online learning, graph learning, sampling methods and data augmentation.

## Papers of Interest in Machine Learning 

- **International Conference on Machine Learning**
	> - Challenging Common Assumptions in the Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations
	> - Analogies Explained: Towards Understanding Word Embeddings
	> - Towards a Unified Analysis of Random Fourier Features
	
- **International Conference on Learning Representations**
	> - Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning
	> - Smoothness and Stability in GANs
	> - AUGMIX: A Simple Data Processing Method to Improve Robustness and Uncertainty
	> - BatchEnsemble: An Alternative Approach to Efficient Ensemble and Lifelong Learning
	> - Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights(CLAW)
	> - Scalable and Order-Robust Continual Learning with Additive Parameter Decomposition
