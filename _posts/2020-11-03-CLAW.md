# CLAW

1. Probabilistic Modeling
2. Variational Inference
3. SOTA on six classification benchmarks

## Review
> -Shortcomings of Previous Methods : Dividing the model into **global** and **local** part restricts flexibility.
> -Problem to be solved : Data driven approach to determine the **appropriate amount of sharing** across tasks are needed.
> -How to solve :
